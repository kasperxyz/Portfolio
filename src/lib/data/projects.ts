      "<h3>Background</h3>",
      "<p>Creators were using Linktree to connect audiences with their content, stores, and social channels - often juggling multiple platforms and linking out to an average of nine different destinations. Linktree saw an opportunity to go beyond just linking out. By engaging in new partnerships with creator platforms, the team aimed to expand the visitor experience and help creators connect, monetize, and grow - all in one place.</p>",
      "<p>Behind the scenes, the challenge was more intricate: how do you build a design system that scales fast, supports countless integrations, and still feels effortless for millions of users?</p>",
      "<h3>Challenge</h3>",
      "<p>The first challenge from a creator point of view was understanding which features and benefits of partner applications were most useful to them. Additionally, from a business and design perspective, we needed to ensure our solution was flexible and scalable enough to handle a wide range of integrations.</p>",
      "<p>Our primary business goals were to create a virtuous cycle to increase engagement and traffic to our platform and drive conversion across core creator flows.</p>",
      "<img src='/linktree/02.png' alt='Linktree Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Process</h3>",
      "<p>To kick off the project, I joined a cross-functional workshop with Product Designers, Product Managers, Engineers, and senior stakeholders from across the business. During the session, we explored variations of the expanded links exercise using several partner app examples and brainstormed conceptual ideas together.</p>",
      "<p>Following the workshop, our team presented the outcomes to the senior leadership team - a set of hypotheses on how we could enhance the visitor experience and an early conceptual direction to test with creators. Directionally, we aligned on building a system of reusable components that could be combined to create a lightweight partner app experience.</p>",
      "<p>We also agreed on an incremental rollout - phase one focused on technically feasible expanded links, while phase two would introduce more advanced, dynamic link behaviors.</p>",
      "<h3>Approach</h3>",
      "<p>We studied platforms of potential partners like Cameo, TikTok, and OpenSea to identify common patterns in their user experiences - focusing on how they surfaced content and encouraged engagement.</p>",
      "<p>From there, we mapped how these models could translate into the Linktree ecosystem without overwhelming users, integrating core partner experiences within Linktree. This involved defining a flexible structure where integrations could share consistent interaction logic and visual language.</p>",
      "<p>To validate these ideas, we designed a few test integrations, refining how much information each expanded link should reveal and how animations could guide interaction without feeling intrusive.</p>",
      "<img src='/linktree/03.png' alt='Linktree Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Solution</h3>",
      "<p>Our process resulted in a creation of the Visitor Experience Design System - a library of reusable components and interaction patterns that could scale across countless partner integrations. Each component was designed to host various partner app experience like TikTok and Cameo videos, X and Reddit posts, Square and Shopify products and more. Visual hierarchy, animation, and spacing were standardized to maintain clarity and simplicity, while still allowing each integration to showcase its unique features.</p>",
      "<p>By building a reusable system, we enabled faster onboarding of new partner integrations, reduced design redundancy, and gave the Linktree team a toolset that could evolve as the marketplace grew.</p>",
      "<img src='/linktree/04.png' alt='Linktree Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Outcome</h3>",
      "<p>The result was a marketplace framework that helped Linktree and its partners move faster and drive measurable impact:</p>",
      "<div class='modal-metrics'><div class='metric'><p>25%</p><h4>increase in creator <br>monthly revenue</h4></div><div class='metric'><p>85%</p><h4>higher CTR <br>on animated links</h4></div></div>",
      "<p>In the end, we built more than a design system - we built a foundation for creators to earn more, connect more, and show up better online. The new Marketplace  drove higher engagement and retention, giving creators more ways to monetize their profiles. It opened up fresh revenue streams for Linktree and increased business opportunities.</p>"

      "<p>Creators were using Linktree to connect audiences with their content, stores, and social channels - often juggling multiple platforms and linking out to an average of nine different destinations. Linktree saw an opportunity to go beyond just linking out. That gave birth to the concept of the Marketplace - a directory where people could browse various integrations and add them to their Linktree to expand the visitor experience and help creators connect, monetize, and grow.</p>",
      "<h3>Challenge</h3>",
      "<p>The Marketplace needed to be seamlessly integrated within existing creator flows - allowing users to access integrations directly through both the admin panel and the Linktree site, driving higher conversion rates and engagement.</p>",
      "<p>Our team’s role was to design the Linktree Marketplace website - a discovery hub where new and existing users could explore, learn about, and install partner integrations effortlessly.</p>",
      "<img src='/marketplace/02.png' alt='Linktree Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Process</h3>",
      "<p>To bring the Marketplace vision to life, we began by conceptualizing the first iterations of the experience. Our goal was to design a system that felt native to Linktree while supporting future scalability.</p>",
      "<p>Then we defined the interaction model, visual hierarchy, and card structure. Partnering closely with engineers and content strategists, we explored multiple layouts and filtering systems to find the right balance between clarity, scalability, and performance.</p>",
      "<p>Through continuous feedback loops with partner teams and creators, we refined flows for browsing, searching, and installing integrations - ensuring the experience remained simple, fast, and creator-first.</p>",
      "<img src='/marketplace/03.png' alt='Linktree Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Solution</h3>",
      "<p>The result was the Linktree Marketplace - a centralized ecosystem where creators can easily browse, search, and connect partner integrations. The modular design system allowed for rapid onboarding of new apps, ensuring scalability and consistency as the ecosystem grew.</p>",
      "<p>Each app card was designed as a reusable component, hosting metadata, visuals, and call-to-action states - adaptable to any partner, from TikTok and Shopify to Discord and Cameo.</p>",
      "<img src='/marketplace/04.png' alt='Linktree Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Outcome</h3>",
      "<p>The Marketplace launched with over 30 app integrations - including Spotify, TikTok, and Bandsintown - making it easier for creators to find, connect, and activate partner experiences directly from their Linktree.</p>",
      "<div class='modal-metrics'><div class='metric'><p>68%</p><h4>increase in creator revenue <br>through Spring integration</h4></div><div class='metric'><p>53%</p><h4>growth in partner <br>traffic from Linktree</h4></div></div>",
      "<p>In the end, the Marketplace streamlined discovery and integration for millions of creators. It not only strengthened Linktree’s ecosystem of partners but also became a key driver of creator monetization and engagement.</p>"

      "<h3>Challenge</h3>",
      "<p>As the platform grew, monitoring and maintaining scraper performance became increasingly complex. Much of the oversight relied on manual scripts and fragmented logs, making it difficult to detect issues early or share context between teams. My role was to design an internal dashboard that made data operations visible, proactive, and scalable.</p>",
      "<img src='/truckmap/02.png' alt='Truckmap Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Process</h3>",
      "<p>To understand the problem deeply, I interviewed engineers and data analysts to map existing workflows and uncover pain points. Together, we identified the key information needed for effective monitoring - scraper health, data freshness, and error trends. From there, I sketched initial concepts and collaborated with engineers to align the design with real system capabilities and metrics pipelines.</p>",
      "<img src='/truckmap/03.png' alt='Truckmap Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Solution</h3>",
      "<p>Working closely with the engineering team, I designed an internal dashboard that provided live visibility into scraper status, data freshness, and error patterns. A clear information hierarchy allowed users to scan system health at a glance, while drill-down views enabled quick troubleshooting and root-cause analysis. The design emphasized actionability - surfacing what needed attention first.</p>",

      "<p>Restaurant owners were juggling scattered checklists, inconsistent inspections, and new safety expectations - all while managing daily operations.</p>",
      "<p>The challenge was to create a product that could gather verified safety information from restaurants, automatically reward them with a Dinesafe certificate, and provide a public-facing experience where diners could easily view a restaurant’s safety score and certification.</p>",
      "<p>The solution had to balance simplicity for owners with transparency and trust for diners.</p>",
      "<img src='/dinesafe/02.png' alt='Dinesafe Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Process</h3>",
      "<p>As the lead designer, I guided both product strategy and UX direction. I began by conducting workshops with the founders and early stakeholders to understand their vision and align on business goals.</p>",
      "<p>From there, I created user stories focusing on two key flows - restaurant owners verifying their compliance, and diners discovering and validating certified restaurants.</p>",
      "<p>I then designed low-fidelity wireframes and consulted directly with restaurant owners, walking them step-by-step through the flows and collecting feedback on what worked and what needed improvement.</p>",
      "<p>Once the direction was validated, I moved into final design, refining the visual language and interaction details to make the platform intuitive and trustworthy.</p>",
      "<img src='/dinesafe/03.png' alt='Dinesafe Hero Image' />",
      "<h3>Solution</h3>",
      "<p>The final solution was an admin panel for restaurant owners, presenting a daily survey where they could upload proof - such as photos of hand sanitizers or cleaning logs - to verify compliance with safety protocols.</p>",
      "<p>Based on the submitted evidence and survey completion, restaurants were rewarded with a Dinesafe certificate, signaling verified safety standards.</p>",
      "<p>Each restaurant also received a public landing page featuring its details, menu, and most importantly, a safety score - giving diners an easy way to review the precautions each venue was taking to keep them safe.</p>",
